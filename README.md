=====================

Nautilus extension to open ex falso in the selected or current directory

If you're like me, you have a large media collection. Managing metadata on this collection can often prove difficult without the proper application. I have found that for my personal preferences, Ex Falso is the best program for editing metadata.  The purpose of this extension is simply to add a menu item in the Nautilus right click menu which will open Ex Falso in the given directory.
